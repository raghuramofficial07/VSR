## » Introduction

Core Data is a powerful framework provided by Apple, essential for managing the model layer objects within an application. It offers a generalized and automated approach to common tasks related to object lifecycle and object graph management, including persistence. The framework is designed to significantly reduce the amount of code developers need to write for the model layer, often by 50 to 70 percent, due to its comprehensive built-in features.

Key benefits of Core Data include:
*   **Change tracking and undo/redo management** beyond basic text editing.
*   **Maintenance of relationship consistency** and change propagation among objects.
*   **Lazy loading, faulting, and copy-on-write data sharing** to optimize overhead.
*   **Automatic validation** of property values, ensuring data integrity. Managed objects extend key-value coding validation to ensure values are within acceptable ranges.
*   **Schema migration tools** for efficient in-place updates to your data model.
*   **Optional integration** with the application's controller layer for UI synchronization.
*   **Grouping, filtering, and organizing data** both in memory and within the user interface.
*   **Automatic support for storing objects** in external data repositories.
*   **Sophisticated query compilation**, allowing complex queries using `NSPredicate` objects instead of raw SQL.
*   **Version tracking and optimistic locking** for multiwriter conflict resolution.
*   **Effective integration** with macOS and iOS development toolchains.

Core Data achieves its functionality through a schema called a **managed object model**, an instance of `NSManagedObjectModel`. This model maps records from a persistent store to the managed objects used in your application. The richer the model, the better Core Data can support your application. While examples often relate to databases, Core Data is versatile and can be used for various application types, not just database-style ones.

## » CRUD Operation Explanations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. In Core Data, these operations are performed on **managed objects** within a **managed object context**, which interacts with the **persistent store** via a **persistent store coordinator**.

### » Create

Creating data in Core Data begins with defining your application's schema using a **managed object model** (`.xcdatamodeld` file in Xcode).
*   **Entities**: An entity describes a type of object, similar to a table in a database, including its name and the class used to represent it in your application. To create an entity, you click "Add Entity" in the Core Data model editor, name it, and press Return. An example is an "Employee" entity with attributes like date of birth, name, and start date. The entity name and the class name (a subclass of `NSManagedObject`) do not need to be the same, but both are required. Entities can also be made **abstract** if no instances of that entity will be created directly, typically for parent entities with concrete subentities.
*   **Attributes and Relationships**: Once an entity is selected, you can add attributes (properties like `String`, `Date`, `Integer`) and relationships to it. Attributes can be optional or mandatory; for numeric values, a mandatory attribute with a default value of 0 is generally preferred over an optional one to avoid `NULL` comparison issues in SQL. Relationships can be to-one or to-many. For bidirectional relationships, two relationships must be created and set as inverses of each other. Transient attributes can also be defined, which are not saved to the persistent store but tracked for undo operations.
*   **Instantiating Objects**: While the model defines the structure, actual data (managed objects) are created later when your application runs. These managed objects are instances of `NSManagedObject` or its subclasses.

### » Read (Fetch)

Reading data in Core Data involves fetching managed objects from the persistent store. Core Data provides sophisticated query compilation, allowing you to create complex queries using `NSPredicate` objects with fetch requests.
*   **Fetch Requests**: Fetch requests are used to define the criteria for retrieving objects. An `NSFetchRequest` object specifies the entity type and can include predicates for filtering and sort descriptors for ordering.
*   **Predicates**: An `NSPredicate` object specifies the conditions that managed objects must meet to be returned by a fetch request. `NSPredicate` can describe filtering logic without writing SQL.
*   **Sort Descriptors**: `NSSortDescriptor` objects specify the order in which the fetched results should be presented.
*   **Store Type Differences**: How predicates and sort descriptors are evaluated varies by persistent store type.
    *   For XML, binary, and in-memory stores, evaluation happens in Objective-C, leveraging all Cocoa functionality.
    *   For SQLite stores, predicates and sort descriptors are compiled into SQL and evaluated directly in the database for performance. This means certain Cocoa-dependent comparison methods or sorting on transient properties are not supported for SQLite. Supported sort selectors for SQLite include `compare:`, `caseInsensitiveCompare:`, `localizedCompare:`, `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare:`, and `localizedStandardCompare:`.
*   **Predicate Constraints for SQLite**: The SQLite store has specific constraints, such as limiting to one to-many element in a key path (`toOne.toMany.toMany` or `toMany.toOne.toMany` constructions are not allowed), and only one `ALL`, `ANY`, or `IN` operator per predicate.
*   **To-Many Relationship Predicates**: When filtering based on a to-many relationship, `ANY` or `ALL` operators are required. For example, to find departments where *any* employee's first name matches "Matthew", you'd use `ANY employees.firstName like 'Matthew'`. For wildcard matching with `ANY` in search fields, wildcards must be substituted first in code rather than directly in the predicate binding string.
*   **Entity Inheritance and Fetches**: If a fetch request specifies a parent entity, it will return matching instances of that entity and its subentities. If an abstract parent entity is specified, it fetches matching instances of concrete subentities.

### » Update

Updating data in Core Data involves modifying the properties of existing managed objects. Since Core Data tracks changes to managed objects within a managed object context, any modifications made to an object's attributes or relationships are automatically tracked. When the managed object context is saved, these changes are persisted to the store.
*   **Modifying Attributes**: You simply set new values for the attributes of a managed object.
*   **Modifying Relationships**: You can add or remove objects from a to-many relationship (e.g., adding an employee to a department) or change the destination of a to-one relationship.
*   **Saving Changes**: The `save()` method on the managed object context commits all pending changes to the persistent store.

### » Delete

Deleting data in Core Data involves removing managed objects from the managed object context and, subsequently, from the persistent store when the context is saved.
*   **Managed Object Context Deletion**: You instruct the managed object context to delete a specific managed object.
*   **SQLite File Behavior**: Simply deleting a record from an SQLite store does not guarantee an immediate reduction in the file size. SQLite organizes its file into pages using B-trees, which is efficient for searching and storage. When records are deleted, holes may be left in the file. SQLite's automatic database vacuuming or filling of these holes with new data can reduce file size, but this is managed by SQLite itself based on operations performed.

## » Code Examples

The following Swift code examples illustrate common Core Data CRUD operations. While these specific code implementations are standard Core Data practices for iOS UIKit applications, they are not found verbatim as complete, ready-to-use CRUD functions in the provided source excerpts. The sources do provide Swift examples for persistent store migration and setting metadata, which are included below.

### » Setup (Core Data Stack)

To interact with Core Data, you need a setup that includes `NSPersistentContainer`. This is typically done in `AppDelegate` or a dedicated Core Data manager.

```swift
import CoreData // Import the Core Data framework
import Foundation // Import Foundation framework for basic types

class CoreDataManager {
    // MARK: - Core Data Stack

    // Create a persistent container, which handles the Core Data stack setup.
    // The "YourModelName" should match the name of your .xcdatamodeld file.
    lazy var persistentContainer: NSPersistentContainer = {
        let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "YourModelName") //
        // Load the persistent stores. This prepares Core Data to save and fetch data.
        container.loadPersistentStores(completionHandler: { (storeDescription, error) in
            // Handle any errors that occur during store loading.
            if let error = error as NSError? {
                // In a real application, you'd log this error or present it to the user.
                fatalError("Unresolved error \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
            }
        })
        return container
    }()

    // The managed object context is where you interact with managed objects.
    // It's like a scratchpad for your data.
    var managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext {
        return persistentContainer.viewContext // Access the main context from the container
    }

    // MARK: - Saving Context

    // A utility method to save changes made in the managed object context.
    func saveContext () {
        let context = managedObjectContext
        // Check if there are any pending changes in the context.
        if context.hasChanges {
            do {
                try context.save() // Attempt to save the changes to the persistent store.
            } catch {
                // Handle the error if saving fails.
                let nserror = error as NSError
                // In a production app, you would log this and potentially offer recovery.
                fatalError("Unresolved error \(nserror), \(nserror.userInfo)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### » Create Operation Example

This example demonstrates how to create a new managed object and save it to the persistent store. Assuming an "Event" entity with a "timestamp" attribute.

```swift
// Assuming 'YourEntity' is an NSManagedObject subclass generated from your .xcdatamodeld
// Or, if using generic NSManagedObject, refer to entity name.

// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

// 1. Create a new managed object instance for the "Event" entity.
// NSEntityDescription is used to describe an entity in your model.
// insertNewObject(forEntityName:into:) adds a new object to the context.
if let newEvent = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObject(forEntityName: "Event", into: context) as? Event {
    // 2. Set the attributes for the new managed object.
    newEvent.timestamp = Date() // Set the 'timestamp' attribute to the current date and time.
    newEvent.title = "My New Event" // Assuming an optional 'title' attribute.

    // 3. Save the changes to the persistent store.
    coreDataManager.saveContext() // This will commit the new event to the database.
    print("Event created successfully: \(newEvent.title ?? "Untitled") at \(newEvent.timestamp ?? Date())")
} else {
    print("Failed to create new Event object.")
}
```

### » Read Operation Example (Fetch)

This example shows how to fetch managed objects using `NSFetchRequest` and `NSPredicate`.

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

// 1. Create a fetch request for the "Event" entity.
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<Event>(entityName: "Event") // Specify the entity to fetch from.

// 2. (Optional) Add a predicate to filter results.
// This predicate will fetch events that occurred after a specific date.
let dateThreshold = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -7, to: Date())! // Events from last 7 days.
// NSPredicate allows complex queries without writing SQL.
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "timestamp > %@", dateThreshold as NSDate)

// 3. (Optional) Add sort descriptors to order the results.
// Sort the fetched events by timestamp in descending order.
let sortDescriptor = NSSortDescriptor(key: "timestamp", ascending: false)
fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [sortDescriptor] //

do {
    // 4. Execute the fetch request on the managed object context.
    let fetchedEvents = try context.fetch(fetchRequest) // Perform the fetch.

    // 5. Process the fetched results.
    if fetchedEvents.isEmpty {
        print("No events found matching the criteria.")
    } else {
        print("Fetched \(fetchedEvents.count) events:")
        for event in fetchedEvents {
            print("- \(event.title ?? "Untitled") on \(event.timestamp ?? Date())")
        }
    }
} catch {
    // Handle any errors during the fetch operation.
    print("Failed to fetch events: \(error)")
}

// Example of fetching with 'ANY' operator for to-many relationship (if applicable, not in simple Event model):
// let predicateWithAny = NSPredicate(format: "ANY employees.firstName like 'Matthew'", argumentArray: nil) //
// fetchRequest.predicate = predicateWithAny
```

### » Update Operation Example

This example demonstrates how to modify an existing managed object and save the changes.

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

// 1. First, fetch the object you want to update.
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<Event>(entityName: "Event")
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "title == %@", "My New Event") // Find the event created earlier.

do {
    let fetchedEvents = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
    // Assuming we want to update the first matching event.
    if let eventToUpdate = fetchedEvents.first {
        // 2. Modify the attributes of the managed object.
        eventToUpdate.title = "Updated Event Title" // Change the title.
        eventToUpdate.timestamp = Date() // Update the timestamp to now.

        // 3. Save the changes to the persistent store.
        coreDataManager.saveContext()
        print("Event updated successfully to: \(eventToUpdate.title ?? "Untitled") at \(eventToUpdate.timestamp ?? Date())")
    } else {
        print("Event with title 'My New Event' not found for update.")
    }
} catch {
    print("Failed to fetch or update event: \(error)")
}
```

### » Delete Operation Example

This example shows how to delete a managed object from the persistent store.

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

// 1. First, fetch the object(s) you want to delete.
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<Event>(entityName: "Event")
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "title == %@", "Updated Event Title") // Find the updated event.

do {
    let fetchedEvents = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
    // Assuming we want to delete all matching events.
    for eventToDelete in fetchedEvents {
        // 2. Delete the managed object from the context.
        context.delete(eventToDelete) // Mark the object for deletion.
        print("Event '\(eventToDelete.title ?? "Untitled")' marked for deletion.")
    }

    // 3. Save the context to commit the deletion(s) to the persistent store.
    coreDataManager.saveContext()
    print("Events deleted successfully.")
    // Note: Deleting records from SQLite does not always immediately reduce file size.
} catch {
    print("Failed to fetch or delete event: \(error)")
}
```

### » Batch Delete Example

Core Data also supports batch operations for more efficient deletions, especially for large datasets. This often bypasses the `NSManagedObjectContext` and directly affects the persistent store, avoiding loading all objects into memory.

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

// 1. Create a fetch request for the entities to be deleted.
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<NSFetchRequestResult>(entityName: "Event") // Fetch request for results as NSFetchRequestResult.
// Optional: Add a predicate to specify which objects to delete.
// This example deletes all events older than 30 days.
let thirtyDaysAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -30, to: Date())!
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "timestamp < %@", thirtyDaysAgo as NSDate)

// 2. Create a batch delete request using the fetch request.
// NSBatchDeleteRequest directly operates on the persistent store via coordinator.
let batchDeleteRequest = NSBatchDeleteRequest(fetchRequest: fetchRequest)

do {
    // 3. Execute the batch delete request.
    // Ensure the persistent store coordinator is used for batch operations.
    try coreDataManager.persistentContainer.persistentStoreCoordinator.execute(batchDeleteRequest, with: context)
    print("Batch delete operation completed.")
    // Note: The context itself might still contain 'faults' for deleted objects.
    // You might need to reset the context or refetch to reflect changes.
    context.reset() // Reset the context to clear any stale objects or faults.
} catch {
    print("Failed to perform batch delete: \(error)")
}
```

### » Store Migration Example

This Swift code snippet, directly from the sources, demonstrates how to migrate a Core Data store from one URL/location to another, and optionally change its type (e.g., to SQLite).

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let psc = coreDataManager.persistentContainer.persistentStoreCoordinator //

let oldURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/old/store.xml") // Placeholder for the old store's URL
let newURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/new/store.sqlite") // Placeholder for the new store's URL

guard let oldStore = psc.persistentStore(for: oldURL) else { //
    fatalError("Failed to reference old store") // Handle error if old store isn't found
}

do {
    // Migrate the persistent store to a new URL and type (e.g., NSSQLiteStoreType)
    try psc.migratePersistentStore(oldStore, to: newURL, options: nil, withType: NSSQLiteStoreType) //
    print("Store migrated successfully from \(oldURL.lastPathComponent) to \(newURL.lastPathComponent) as SQLite.")
} catch {
    fatalError("Failed to migrate store: \(error)") // Handle migration errors
}
```

### » Setting Metadata Example

This Swift code snippet, directly from the sources, illustrates how to associate custom metadata with a Core Data store.

```swift
// Initialize the Core Data manager.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let psc = coreDataManager.persistentContainer.persistentStoreCoordinator //

// Assuming 'url' is the URL to your active persistent store.
// For the primary store, you might retrieve it from persistentContainer.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.first?.url
let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "url to store") // Placeholder URL

guard let store = psc.persistentStore(for: url) else { //
    fatalError("Failed to retrieve store from \(url)") // Handle error if store isn't found
}

var metadata = store.metadata // Get a mutable copy of the existing metadata
metadata["MyKeyWord"] = "MyStoredValue" // Add or update a custom key-value pair
store.metadata = metadata // Set the updated metadata back to the store

// Note: If using setMetadata:forPersistentStore:, you must save the context for changes to persist.
// If you were using the class method setMetadata:forPersistentStoreOfType:URL:error:, metadata would be updated immediately.

coreDataManager.saveContext() // Save the context to persist the metadata change.
print("Custom metadata added to store.")
```

## » Concept Highlights

### » Managed Object Context (NSManagedObjectContext)

The `NSManagedObjectContext` acts as a **scratchpad** or an in-memory editing area for your managed objects. It is the primary object you interact with when performing CRUD operations.
*   **Life Cycle**: Managed objects live in the context. When you create, modify, or delete a managed object, you do so within a context.
*   **Change Tracking**: The context is responsible for tracking all changes made to its managed objects. This includes attribute modifications, relationship changes, and object insertions or deletions.
*   **Saving**: When you save the context, all pending changes are written to the persistent store. If you don't save, the changes are lost.
*   **Undo/Redo**: Core Data's built-in undo and redo capabilities operate at the context level.
*   **Concurrency**: Contexts are generally not thread-safe. Each thread should typically have its own context, or operations should be performed on the main context from the main thread.

### » Persistent Container (NSPersistentContainer)

Introduced in iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, `NSPersistentContainer` simplifies the setup and management of the Core Data stack.
*   **Stack Management**: It encapsulates the `NSManagedObjectModel`, `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`, and `NSManagedObjectContext` into a single, easy-to-use object.
*   **Main Context**: It provides a `viewContext` property, which is the primary `NSManagedObjectContext` for interacting with the UI on the main thread.
*   **Background Tasks**: `NSPersistentContainer` also simplifies creating background contexts for performing operations off the main thread.

### » Fetch Requests (NSFetchRequest & NSPredicate)

Fetch requests are the mechanism for retrieving data from your Core Data store.
*   **NSFetchRequest**: An instance of `NSFetchRequest` defines what data you want to retrieve. It specifies the entity type and can include predicates for filtering and sort descriptors for ordering.
*   **NSPredicate**: `NSPredicate` objects allow you to define complex query conditions. Instead of writing SQL, you can use `NSPredicate` to describe filtering logic.
    *   **SQLite Performance**: For SQLite stores, predicates are compiled into SQL for performance, but this imposes certain limitations, such as constraints on key paths involving multiple to-many relationships.
    *   **`ANY` / `ALL` Operators**: Essential for filtering based on to-many relationships.
    *   **Wildcard Matching**: For patterns like prefix/suffix searches (e.g., `like 'Matt*'`), wildcards need to be explicitly substituted into the predicate format string when used with search field bindings.

### » Batch Operations & Performance Optimization

Core Data offers several features and considerations for optimizing performance, especially with large datasets or complex operations.

#### » Faulting

**Faulting** is a core performance optimization technique in Core Data.
*   **Lazy Loading**: When you fetch managed objects, Core Data often returns "faults" instead of fully materialized objects. A fault is a placeholder object that represents a managed object but has not yet had its property values loaded into memory.
*   **Reduced Overhead**: This "lazy loading" mechanism significantly reduces memory overhead, as the full object graph does not need to reside in memory simultaneously.
*   **Automatic Materialization**: When you access a property of a fault for the first time, Core Data automatically materializes it by fetching the necessary data from the persistent store.

#### » Performance Optimization Strategies

*   **Choose the Right Persistent Store Type**:
    *   **SQLite (`NSSQLiteStoreType`)** is recommended for deployed applications with large datasets due to its high performance and ability to load data partially (not requiring the entire object graph in memory).
    *   **XML (`NSXMLStoreType`)** is slower and loads the whole object graph, but it's human-readable and useful for inspecting data early in development (not available on iOS).
    *   **Binary (`NSBinaryStoreType`)** is fast and loads the whole graph, useful for atomic writes.
    *   **In-Memory (`NSInMemoryStoreType`)** is fast, loads the whole graph, and requires no on-disk storage, suitable for temporary data or testing.
*   **SQLite Specific Optimizations**:
    *   **Predicate and Sort Descriptor Translation**: SQLite compiles predicates and sort descriptors to SQL for direct database evaluation, which is faster. However, predicates relying on non-Cocoa-supported comparisons or sorting on transient properties will not work.
    *   **Predicate Constraints**: Be mindful of constraints like only one to-many element in a key path in a predicate for SQLite stores.
    *   **`noindex:` Hint**: Use `noindex:` in predicates to prevent SQLite from using specific indices, which can sometimes improve query performance by overriding SQLite's index selection.
    *   **Save Behavior (`F_FULLFSYNC`)**: On macOS, Core Data uses `F_FULLFSYNC` when saving to SQLite to ensure data is written to the drive platter immediately, reducing the risk of data corruption in case of system failure. This can make saves to SQLite appear slower than to XML stores for small changes.
    *   **File System Support**: SQLite stores offer best concurrent read/write support on byte-range locking file systems (HFS+, AFP, NFS). They do not support writing to WebDAV file systems.
*   **Attribute Design**:
    *   **Avoid Optional Numeric Attributes**: For numeric values, it's generally better to use a mandatory attribute with a default value of 0 rather than an optional one. This is because SQL's `NULL` behavior differs from Objective-C's `nil`, and `NULL` values don't match 0 in searches.
    *   **Transient Attributes**: While useful for calculated or derived values, transient attributes are not saved to the persistent store and cannot be sorted on directly using the SQLite store.
*   **Entity Inheritance**:
    *   **SQLite Performance Impact**: When using entity inheritance with SQLite persistent stores, all entities that inherit from another entity exist within the same table. This design can lead to performance issues and should be considered carefully.
*   **Batch Operations**: For large-scale data modifications (like deletion of many records), **batch requests** (e.g., `NSBatchDeleteRequest`) can significantly improve performance by executing the operation directly on the persistent store without loading managed objects into memory. This is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources but is a common Core Data optimization related to deletion.
*   **Metadata Management**: When setting metadata, using `setMetadata:forPersistentStore:` and saving the context is preferred over `setMetadata:forPersistentStoreOfType:URL:error:` if there are unsaved changes, to avoid warnings about external file modification.

## » Real-World Use Cases

Here are practical examples of CRUD operations applied in common iOS applications.

### » Notes App: Saving a New Note

**Operation:** Create
**Scenario:** A user creates a new note in a notes application.

```swift
// Assuming 'Note' is an NSManagedObject subclass with 'title', 'content', and 'creationDate' attributes.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

func createNewNote(title: String, content: String) {
    if let newNote = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObject(forEntityName: "Note", into: context) as? Note {
        newNote.title = title
        newNote.content = content
        newNote.creationDate = Date()
        coreDataManager.saveContext()
        print("New note '\(title)' created successfully.")
    } else {
        print("Failed to create new Note object.")
    }
}

// Example usage:
createNewNote(title: "Meeting Summary", content: "Discussed Q3 results and next steps for project X.")
```

### » Task Manager: Reading Tasks

**Operation:** Read (Fetch)
**Scenario:** A user opens a task manager and wants to see all pending tasks due today.

```swift
// Assuming 'Task' is an NSManagedObject subclass with 'title', 'dueDate', and 'isCompleted' attributes.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

func fetchPendingTasksDueToday() -> [Task] {
    let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<Task>(entityName: "Task")

    // Define the start and end of today.
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let todayStart = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date())
    let todayEnd = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: todayStart)!

    // Predicate to find tasks due today and not completed.
    fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "dueDate >= %@ AND dueDate < %@ AND isCompleted == NO",
                                         todayStart as NSDate, todayEnd as NSDate) //

    // Sort tasks by dueDate.
    fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "dueDate", ascending: true)]

    do {
        let tasks = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
        print("Fetched \(tasks.count) pending tasks due today.")
        return tasks
    } catch {
        print("Failed to fetch tasks: \(error)")
        return []
    }
}

// Example usage:
let pendingTasks = fetchPendingTasksDueToday()
for task in pendingTasks {
    print("- Task: \(task.title ?? "Untitled"), Due: \(task.dueDate ?? Date())")
}
```

### » User Profile: Updating a Record

**Operation:** Update
**Scenario:** A user updates their email address in their profile settings.

```swift
// Assuming 'UserProfile' is an NSManagedObject subclass with 'name' and 'email' attributes.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

func updateUserEmail(userName: String, newEmail: String) {
    let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<UserProfile>(entityName: "UserProfile")
    fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "name == %@", userName)

    do {
        let users = try context.fetch(fetchRequest)
        if let userProfile = users.first { // Assuming 'name' is unique for simplicity.
            userProfile.email = newEmail // Update the email attribute.
            coreDataManager.saveContext() // Save the changes.
            print("User '\(userName)' email updated to '\(newEmail)'.")
        } else {
            print("User profile for '\(userName)' not found.")
        }
    } catch {
        print("Failed to update user email: \(error)")
    }
}

// Example usage:
updateUserEmail(userName: "John Doe", newEmail: "john.doe.new@example.com")
```

### » Activity History: Deleting Old Entries

**Operation:** Delete
**Scenario:** An application needs to periodically clear old activity log entries (e.g., older than 90 days) to manage storage.

```swift
// Assuming 'ActivityLog' is an NSManagedObject subclass with 'timestamp' and 'action' attributes.
let coreDataManager = CoreDataManager()
let context = coreDataManager.managedObjectContext

func deleteOldActivityLogs(olderThanDays: Int) {
    let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<NSFetchRequestResult> = ActivityLog.fetchRequest()

    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let ninetyDaysAgo = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: -olderThanDays, to: Date())!

    // Predicate to find log entries older than the specified number of days.
    fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "timestamp < %@", ninetyDaysAgo as NSDate)

    // Using NSBatchDeleteRequest for efficient deletion of multiple records without loading them into memory.
    let batchDeleteRequest = NSBatchDeleteRequest(fetchRequest: fetchRequest)

    do {
        let result = try context.execute(batchDeleteRequest) as? NSBatchDeleteResult
        // batchDeleteRequest.resultType = .resultTypeObjectIDs (default is .statusOnly)
        // You would typically reset the context after a batch delete.
        context.reset()
        print("Successfully deleted old activity logs. Status: \(result?.result ?? "N/A")")
        // Note: SQLite file size may not immediately decrease.
    } catch {
        print("Failed to delete old activity logs: \(error)")
    }
}

// Example usage:
deleteOldActivityLogs(olderThanDays: 90)
```
